## Some Key points on C basic concepts:

### Data type decides:
- Number of Bytes reserved => range of values
- Valid operations

### Type modifiers in C language:
- Extend meening of basic data types
- Examples: signed, unsigned, short, and long

### Derived data types:
- Primitive data types are int, float and char.
- Derived data types add functionality to basic data types
- Usefull to create new data types
- Examples: Array, pointers, struct, union, typedef and enum.

### Type conversion hierachy:
- Higher to Lowr: double, float, long, int, short, char
- Signed data types are lower than unsigned
- Signed character and short data are promoted ti integer
- Unsigned character and short data are promoted to unsigned integer.

* Type casting is explicit while type conversion is implicit.

### Valid Sequence points in C language:
- Betweeen evaluation of left and right opeators of && and || and comma operators
- Between evaluation of first operand of conditional operator and its second or third operand
- End of full expression: e.g ; and return statement and controlling expresions of diff control statements.
